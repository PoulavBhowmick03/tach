Tach CLI is an open source 

#### 1. Fork the repository

#### 2. Clone the repository locally
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/github_username/tach.git
cd tach
```
It is adviced to work on a branch of your own and then raise a PR
```bash
git checkout -b "your_feature_name" 
```

#### 3. Create a virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv env
```
Activate the environment 
```bash
source env/Scripts/activate
```

#### 4. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
```

#### 5. Build

This build will reflect changes that are currently existing locally

To build the project - run:

```bash
 pip install .
```
Note: tach is a CI tool to enforce dependencies, using modular architecture. For testing your changes you'll need to set this project up within your own project

#### 6. Test

Tach uses `pytest` module for testing all the files within `python/tests/`
```bash
pytest relative_path_of_file_or_folder_to_test/ # To test everything just run `pytest`
```

#### 7. Setting up the docs
Tach uses mintlify platform to create and maintain public facing documentation
```bash 
npm install -g mintlify
cd docs
mintlify dev # Build docs for a local preview
```

### 8. Things to check before committing
Sync all your dependencies in the root folder
```bash
tach sync
```
Ruff checks (Automatic Linting)
```bash 
ruff check --fix
ruff format --check 
ruff format
```

That's it! You are now ready to push your new dev branch to your forked repo and then raise a PR with appropriate description
